Hi there! My name is Ava Anderson, I'm majoring in computer science and going for a bachelors in arts of computer science.
Two projects I am going to work on this semester are a choose your own adventure program for my computer science class, and I want to make my own project for helping me track my Pokemon run statistics, since the one that I downloaded has a lot of flaws in it's stats.
